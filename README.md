# Photothermal Imaging Theory

This directory contains the mess that is active research on the theory of Photothermal Heterodyne Imaging of single and interacting plasmonic nanoparticles. This work attempts to link diverging perspectives on the theory from the groups like that of Brahim Lounis and Frank Cichos.

The 'python' directory contains more recent work, including a novel solution to the steady-state heat diffusion equation on two spheres (Neumann boundary condition in bispherical coordinates) as well as a therough investigation of the single sphere photothermal image with a thermally- and electromagnetically-retarded model. This last bit is currently under preparation for publication. The work-horse code is contained in the 'modules' module, but has depencencies in the 'misloc_package' where the dipole electrodynamics calculations are implemented. 

The mathematica notebooks contain algebra and early implementations of the analytic theory based on a linear expansion of the particle polarizabilities as function of temperature.
